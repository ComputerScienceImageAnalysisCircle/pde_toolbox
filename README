Prerequisites :
===============


	This code should work on any reasonably POSIX system, as it uses posix threads.
	It has been tested on various versions of Linux, Mac OS/X and Windows using 
	the posix threads at http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/

	The threading code can always be disabled by commenting out the following line

#define CONTMAXFLOW_MULTITHREADED

	in contmaxflow.c

	You will need the GNU development toolchain, available natively with Linux,
	with XCode under OS/X and with mingw32 or cygwin under Windows.

Compilation:
===========
	
	With GNU make, type the following at the prompt (% is the prompt)

% make clean
% make depend
% make
% make test

If all goes well you should obtain a segmentation of a 48x48 image of the heart, similar
to the image "expected_result.pgm". This is an image of the simulated pressure field.
Isolines of this field provide a contour segmentation.

USAGE:
=====

	The result is a stand-alone executable, called "cont_max_flow"

usage: ./cont_max_flow image_to_segment image_source image_sink image_out row col [-d]


       Images are expected in the PGM format. The row and column arguments are redundant
       but compulsory in this version.

       -d shows some debugging messages.

HISTORY:
=======
	Ben Appleton and Hugues Talbot wrote a first 2D version 2002-2004
	Ben Appleton wrote the core this version, 3D capable and multithreaded in 2004-2005
	Camille Couprie wrote the standalone test program and early packaging in mid-2008.
	Patryk Zabkiewicz adjust the Couprie's wrapper to 3D imagery in late-2013.



THANKS:
=======

	This work was made possible thanks to An Australian post-graduate scholarship 
	awarded to Ben Appleton.

	Science and Industry Research Organisation (CSIRO) Australia. He was supported
	2004-2009 by the Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de Paris (CCIP).

	Camille Couprie was supported by Siemens USA 2008.
